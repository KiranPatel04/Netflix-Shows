After 'International Movies' and 'International TV Shows', 'Dramas' followed by 'Comedies' are majority on Netflix.

### 3. Netflix Content Added over the years: 
Based on the timeline below, we can conclude that Netflix started gaining popularity after 2012. Since then, the amount of content added has been increasing significantly. The growth in the number of movies on Netflix is much higher than that on TV shows. Besides, we can know that Netflix has increasingly focused on movies rather than TV shows in recent years

### 4. Netflix Content By Ratings: 
The largest count of Netflix content is made with a “TV-MA” and “TV-14” ratings. “TV-MA” is a rating assigned by the TV Parental Guidelines to a television program designed for mature audiences only. “TV-14” contains material that parents or adult guardians may find unsuitable for children under the age of 14. It also shows that Netflix has very less content when it comes to Children's Movies and Shows.

### 5. Netflix Releases based on Months and Years: 
This analysis shows the total titles (both Movies and TV Shows) released segregated by Months and Years. The heatmap below shows exactly the number of titles released. It can be inferred that November of 2019 saw the highest number of releases with a whopping release of 272 titles and in the January of 2020 the second highest release of 228 titles, which can be understood because of lockdown and stay at home regulated over the world during these months which led to Netflix getting more traction. Also, in general, year end (October through January) are the months with the highest releases which can be apparent because of the Holiday seasons throughout the world.
